# Smart Health Monitoring System

# Overview
This project implements a Smart Health Monitoring System using an ESP32 microcontroller and a heart rate sensor. The system captures real-time heart rate data and can be expanded to monitor other health parameters. The data is processed and displayed on a serial monitor or can be sent wirelessly via Wi-Fi for remote health monitoring.

# Features
Real-time heart rate monitoring
Wireless data transmission (via Wi-Fi)
Low power consumption with ESP32
Portable and easy to build
# Components
ESP32 microcontroller board
Heart rate sensor (e.g., Pulse Sensor, MAX30100)
Jumper wires
Breadboard or PCB for mounting
Power supply (USB or battery)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO for VSCode)
ESP32 Board Manager installed in Arduino IDE
PulseSensor Playground library (if using a pulse sensor)
Wi-Fi library for ESP32 (for wireless data transmission)
# Circuit Diagram
VCC → 3.3V on ESP32
GND → GND on ESP32
Signal Pin → GPIO pin on ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 15)

Heart Rate Sensor Data Reading: The code reads the heart rate data from the sensor using the analog input pin on ESP32.
Data Processing: The captured heart rate is filtered and processed to eliminate noise.
Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ESP32 is connected to a Wi-Fi network to send health data to a remote server or local system (optional).
Data Logging: The heart rate data can be logged on a local server for analysis.

# How to Run
Upload the Code: Load the provided code into your ESP32 board using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
Power the Circuit: Ensure the ESP32 is powered either via USB or an external battery.
Monitor the Data: Open the serial monitor to view the real-time heart rate readings. You can also configure Wi-Fi to send the data to a local server or cloud platform.
# Future Enhancements
Integrating additional sensors like temperature and blood oxygen level (SpO2) sensors.
Displaying data on an OLED or LCD screen.
Mobile app integration for remote health monitoring.
